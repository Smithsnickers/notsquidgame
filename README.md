# notsquidgame

An interactive mobile game inspired by a regional folk game worldwide know and made it into a Trend by the series Squid Game.
There are two parties. One observer and many players. The players try to reach the observer. The observer looks the opposite direction of the players and gives them a time interval in which they can move. Each time the intervall ends the observer turns around to catch the players who're still moving. If someone is moving they're sorted out. 
Everyone who reaches the observer without getting caught wins.
